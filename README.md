install mysql, python

```bash
ansible-playbook up.yml
```

To use mysql:

```bash
mysql -u root -h 127.0.0.1 -p
```

To run github actions like (notice that the environment variables default for the local case):

```yaml
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install MySQL client
        run: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y mysql-client

      - name: Deploy to Database
        env:
          DB_HOST: ${{ secrets.DB_HOST || '127.0.0.1' }} 
          DB_USER: ${{ secrets.DB_ADMIN_USER || 'root' }}
          DB_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.DB_PASSWORD  || 'Secret5555'}}
          DB_NAME: ${{ secrets.DB_NAME || 'mysql' }}
        run: mysql -h $DB_HOST -u $DB_USER -p$DB_PASSWORD $DB_NAME < schema_changes.sql
```

locally:

first try

```bash
bin/act
```

then if that doesn't work 

```bash
bin/act -P ubuntu-latest=-self-hosted
```

to run in the codespace.

To shut down:

```bash
ansible-playbook down.yml
```

There is also a flyway migration here. To run the migration:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "/workspaces/<repo name>/migrations:/flyway/sql" redgate/flyway -user=root -password=Secret5555 -url=jdbc:mysql://172.17.0.1:3306/flyway_test migrate
```

This is a reproducible mysql setup, with a flyway migration. It is also the start of an example of using flyway and github actions together. Flyway (jdbc) needs the database to exist. The github action creates it if it doesn't exist and flyway takes over from there.
